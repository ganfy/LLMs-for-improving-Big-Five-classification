"I'm feeling somewhere between anxious and energized. I have so much work to do and part of me is worried about that, but another part is taking it calmly and doing my work in a medium pace. Hmmm, right now I don't feel very overwhelmed, I mean, for sure I must be, but somehow I am taking it easy. I think it means that I have achieve a certain level of self-control. I guess. I mean, I'm in the middle of what i could call 'a good part' of my life, talking about other areas apart from academic.Talking about physical sensations... this abscence of visible signs of anxiety is an indicator of my self-control. i guess. But I'm not sure of what moments brought me to this level.", "n", "y", "n", "y", "y"
"Somewhat tired but eager to finish my work or try my best., Hmmm... I guess I am kinda motivated lately. Not a lot though. But, days are better this year.,I mean, now I've got a boyfriend, that is definitely something new.,Erm, everything? Haha, well, obviously not everything, but somehow I have no complaints. I've had complicated relationships before, but this one is very peaceful, i must say. We both have a sense of emotional responsibility and are often trying to treat the other like they deserve. Actually, if there is something I can rescue from all my previous relationships, especially this one, is that during our best moments, my relationship withmy parents changes positively, which means  lot as we haven't been always in good terms. But also, surprisingly, I'm improving the way I treat my friends, he sometimes makes me apologize with them or makes me think about things I say or do, to be a better person. Erm, I guess he just asks me to do those things, calmly. Also, he comforts me when i'm not feeling well about some things, and thakes me feel better about everything. Definitely, I think so, in that way he is such a positive influence. He is not perfect though. But, as I said, so far, I have no complaints. We both can improve our faults.", "y", "n", "y", "y", "y"
